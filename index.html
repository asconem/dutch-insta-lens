    <h1>Dutch Insta-Lens — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Dutch Insta-Lens is a browser extension designed to help users learn Dutch by translating Dutch text found in Instagram images. This policy explains what data the extension processes and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>Data We Process</h2>
    <p>When you activate the extension by Shift-clicking an Instagram image, the following data is temporarily processed:</p>
    <p><strong>Image data:</strong> The image you click on is sent to the OCR.space API for optical character recognition (text extraction). This data is sent directly from your browser to the OCR.space service and is not stored by the extension.</p>
    <p><strong>Extracted text:</strong> The Dutch text recognized in the image is sent to the DeepL API (or Google Translate as a fallback) for translation into English. This data is sent directly from your browser to the translation service and is not stored by the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Specifically:</p>
    <p>We do not collect your name, email address, or any account information. We do not track your browsing history or Instagram activity. We do not store any images or translated text. We do not use cookies or any tracking technologies. We do not send any data to our own servers — all processing goes directly from your browser to the third-party APIs listed above.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The extension communicates directly with the following third-party services to provide its functionality:</p>
    <p><strong>OCR.space</strong> (<a href="https://ocr.space/privacypolicy">privacy policy</a>) — for extracting text from images.</p>
    <p><strong>DeepL</strong> (<a href="https://www.deepl.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>) — for translating Dutch text to English.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Translate</strong> (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">privacy policy</a>) — used as a fallback translation service.</p>
    <p>Each of these services has its own privacy policy governing how they handle the data they receive. We encourage you to review their policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>The extension does not retain any data between sessions. All processed text exists only in your browser's memory during active use and is discarded when you navigate away or close the tab.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests access to Instagram domains (instagram.com, cdninstagram.com, fbcdn.net) solely to read images for OCR processing. It also requests access to the API endpoints listed above solely to perform text extraction and translation.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach the developer through the extension's support page on the Chrome Web Store.</p>
